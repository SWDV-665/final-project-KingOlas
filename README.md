This is the ChordScale App; an application designed to help anyone and everyone understand how music works and, more importantly, how to become fluent on your instrument by prodiving the user with both the visual note-name data specific to the chord (dependent on context) and the sounds/frequencies that are associated with these notes. The synchronicity between what you hear in your head / what you actually hear, the knowledge of what you can use these sounds for in certain situations, and the physical action of playing these notes/sounds on your particular instrument(s) is what leads to understanding and musical fluency!

As of Nov 6, 2021:
  - Main Functions operating as intended
  - Theme Colors in place
  - Howler.js Media Service operating
  - ChordScale Algorithm properly processes keyDict Chord Data
  - Future Goals: 
      - Finish populating mp3 tracks
      - Refine/Clean-Up UI
      - Toggle Audio Buttons / Work out Stop Button Bug
