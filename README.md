This is the ChordScale App; an application designed to help anyone understand how music works and how to play with anyone!

As of August 22, 2021:
  - Main Functions and Theming Finished: getChord() produces and displays correct data, as well as getTrack()

How To Run:
  - To use ChordScale, download ChordScale folder and run "ionic capacitor build ios"
  - Using an Apple Device connected to XCode, you will be able to use the app and playback audio using the Native Media API from Cordova
